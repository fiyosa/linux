# WAI - Winetricks Auto Install Script

This Bash script is designed to simplify the installation of Wine configurations via the Winetricks Terminal. You no longer need to install them manually, as the installer handles everything, including potential errors. The tutorial only provides guidance.

   cd wai/
   ```
4. Grant execution permissions to the script files:
   ```bash
   chmod +x rgame.sh winetricks_list_1.sh winetricks_list_2.sh winetricks_list_3.sh winetricks_list_4_OpenGL.sh winetricks_list_4_VulkanSupport.sh
   ```
5. Run the scripts as a **user** (not root) :
### Note: wait until completion for each running session
   ```bash
   ./winetricks_list_1.sh
   ```
